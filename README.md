# CryptoClustering Challenge: Unveiling Hidden Trends in Cryptocurrency Market Behavior

*Unsupervised Machine Learning Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 19*

## Background

This CryptoClustering assignment uses Python and unsupervised machine learning to explore the effects of 24-hour and 7-day price changes on various cryptocurrencies. Using K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we aim to reveal underlying relationships, trends, and clustering patterns in the cryptocurrency market.


### Dependencies

To run the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `hvplot` for interactive data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning and data preprocessing

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas hvplot scikit-learn
```

## Assignment Files

The repository contains the following essential files:

- `crypto_market_data.csv`: Holds the raw market data for various cryptocurrencies.
- `Crypto Cluster.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook that contains Python code and analysis.

By using unsupervised learning techniques like K-means and PCA, this assignment hopes to offer valuable insights into the often chaotic world of cryptocurrency markets. The results of this analysis can be used to inform investment decisions and help investors make more informed decisions.

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

The details of which are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.
All code is written in *Visual Studio Code* and *Jupyter Notebook* using *Python 3.11*.
